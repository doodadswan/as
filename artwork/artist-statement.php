<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p class="artist">My art is very expressionistic, yet it varies stylistically ranging from abstraction to figural.  I love working with oil paint, collage, and digital art, as well as utilizing various technologies, ranging from Adobe Creative Suite, to more traditional technologies, such as printmaking, and imploring mixed media approaches.  I am strongly influenced by Dada, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism.  I admire how the surrealists and expressionists embraced the subconscious and allowed this to enter into their work.  I am extremely fond of the subtleties of the human form and consider myself a lifelong student of color.  My professional background includes working in the fields of information technology and education.  I consider art a lifelong exploration and enjoy the process as much or more than any of the pieces that come to be along the way. </p>
