<p>Shintoism is the ancient religion and belief of Japan. It is characterized by their great respect of nature spirits and of their ancestors. Shinto followers believe that the first Emperor, or king of Japan, was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu. </p>
<p>One of the main Shinto practices is that of worship and offerings to kami, a sacred power or force, at shrines or at home. </p>
<p>Nature is very important in Shintoism. Followers believe that everything in nature has a spirit, such as the sun, trees, or even the mountains!</p>
