		<h2>The Creation of the Web</h2>
		<p>Check out the story of how the World Wide Web came to be. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/The_history_of_the_Web#The_creation_of_World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">article </a>is found on the W3.org website. This is the consortium in charge of the web and its standards.</p>
		<h2>Additive &amp; Subtractive Color</h2>
		<p>Early photgraphy utilized film, which relied on traditional, subtractive color models. Modern digital cameras rely on additive color models. </p>
		<p>In a nutshell, in subtractive color, when colors are combined, form black. While on the other hand, additive colors when combined form white, or to be technical, light.</p>
