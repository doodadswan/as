		<h2>Browser Wars</h2>
		<p>What happens when nerds get angry? Well, lots of things! But one of the most interesting phenomenons of the early Web universe was the Browser Wars. The Browser Wars were started when a lot of web developers began to grow tired of the dominance that Microsoft had regarding how they &quot;interpreted&quot; HTML. And by interpreted, I mean literally how Internet Explorer interpreted code. This began a long, long fight between Microsoft and other browsers. At the time, the leading challenger was Netscape, otherwise known as Mozilla. Mozilla eventually came up with another browser named Firefox. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article that is sure to flare up your nerd rage!</p>
