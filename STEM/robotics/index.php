		<h1>Robotics</h1>
		  <p>My robotics curriculum is a combination of lessons including the LEGO Midstorms Education Curriculum, as well a number of lessons from Damien Kee's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Classroom-Activities-Busy-Teacher-EV3/dp/1491253169/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507162142&sr=8-1&keywords=damien+kee" target="_blank">Classroom Activities for the Busy Teacher</a>. We use LEGO Mindstorm EV3 robots. My robotics unit and my Scratch unit are closely associated in regards to scope and expectations. I have had success at all middle school grade levels teaching programming. I believe the will to learn and the appropriate dedication to the lessons can produce results.</p>
		<p>My curriculum focus on students developing a combination of logical, problem solving skills, while progressively learning more about programming and other critical 21st century skills.</p>
		<p>Once the students learn the basics of programming their robots, they proceed to complete various challanges that often incorporate STEM based objectives. Also, they are encouraged to pursue specific pathways as enrichment activities. The pathways are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Technology/Engineering</li>
		  <li>Science</li>
		  <li>Math</li>
		  <li>Computer Science</li>
		</ul>

		  <h2>Universal Systems Model</h2>
		  <p>The Universal Systems Model is a framework used to simplify a complex system. Most technological systems are complex systems. </p>
		  <h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>
		  <p>We will be using the EDP a lot in    this class, so study, absorb it, become one with it. Click here to study the EDP more in detail.</p>
