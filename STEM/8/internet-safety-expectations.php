		<p>For my Internet Safety and Expectations lesson, I ask my students to review the community guidelines for Scratch, a programming language my grade levels often use during the semester. Also, we discuss my expectations for their online behavior and work together to try and better understand how guidelines and rules for online communities help protect people. I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and anyone else who they make contact with online.  </p>
		<p><strong>Mr. Swan's Online Rules and Expectations. </strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Treat people online as you would in person.  Don’t use anonymity to abuse others online.</li>
		  <li>Be respectful.  Any bullying, name-calling, or other inappropriate behavior will be written up the first time it occurs.</li>
		  <li>Think before you post something.  If you have doubts about posting something, don’t do it!</li>
		  <li>Do not post in ALL CAPS.  It is often interpreted as shouting and should be avoided.</li>
		  <li>Report any inappropriate behavior when you see it happen.  Sometimes people get involved in situations mistakenly, or because of where they are sitting, and because they know of inappropriate behavior and do not let their teachers know what is happening, sometimes get involved in the activity, even though they are innocent.  If you see something happening, or know of something inappropriate happening, it is best to let a teacher know.  Their information will be treated as confidential and will not be shared with anyone other than the administration.</li>
		</ul>
